**Guessing The Number!**

**Overview**

The Guessing Game is a simple web application built with Angular. It presents the user with a random number between 1 and 20 and asks them to guess the correct number. The user enters their guess, and the application provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The user's score decreases with each incorrect guess. The game resets with a new random number and score when the correct number is guessed.
